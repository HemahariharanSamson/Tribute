      <h2>The Heart of My Home &#128158;</h2>
      <p>This is a tribute page to my amazing, lovely parents Samson & Jayachitra. These two lovebirds have been inseparable since the day they met, and their love for each other has only continued to grow stronger over the years. They are not just head over heels for each other, but they also have a deep devotion to their three amazing children, with the eldest being the most amazing, of course &#128521;.<br>
      </br>In my eyes, my parents are the perfect blend of love and laughter &#128525;. They bring joy to everyone they meet and their secret ingredient to a happy life is a spoonful of silliness, a dash of mischief, and a whole lot of love. They have a love for dogs, a soft spot for their parents, and a heart that beats for each other. They are the ultimate definition of cool, quirky, and cuddly, and they prove that love and laughter are the keys to a happy life.</br>
    </br>So let's raise a paw (or a glass &#129346;) to the love story that just keeps getting better. I want to celebrate the Love and Laughter of my parents, who have made an indelible impact on my life and on the lives of those around them. They are the heart of our home, and their love and laughter will forever be cherished in my heart.</br></p>
